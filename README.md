# Non-Parametric Statistics Course Work

## Project Overview
This project is my final course work for Non-Parametric Statistics at the University of Lagos. It is a collection of detailed R Markdown scripts that demonstrate the application of various statistical tests and data visualization techniques. These scripts cover a wide range of topics from quality control in production processes to healthcare studies and educational methodologies. This project serves as a reference for anyone interested in learning how to conduct statistical analyses using R.

## Contents
1. **ANOVA Analysis** - Comparing different teaching methods and their effectiveness.
2. **Correlation Studies** - Examining the relationship between smoking during pregnancy and newborn weights.
3. **Time Series Analysis** - Observing glove usage trends in healthcare before and after an educational intervention.
4. **Non-parametric Tests** - Analyzing data from ecological studies and medical scans to assess different hypotheses.
5. **Control Charts** - Evaluating production stability using quality control data.

## Installation
To run these analyses, you will need R and RStudio installed on your computer. You can download and install R from [The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/) and RStudio from [RStudio's website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

### Dependencies
Install the following R packages to ensure that all scripts run correctly:
```R
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "broom", "ggpubr", "BSDA", "coin", "randtests", "knitr"))
```
## Dependencies
Each script in this repository is an independent R Markdown file. To run an analysis:

Open the R Markdown file in RStudio.
Set the working directory to the file's location.
Click on "Knit" to compile the analysis into a Word, HTML, or PDF document, depending on the configuration at the top of each script.
